# SideNav Rail

A Vaadin Component Factory addon that adds a togglable rail mode to `<vaadin-side-nav>` — collapsed icon-only navigation with on-demand hover popovers, full keyboard support, and Lumo-styled tooltips.

## Features

- **Rail mode toggle** — flip the nav between full-width and rail mode.
- **Hover popovers** for items with children, configurable in scope.
- **Full keyboard navigation** — use arrow keys to navigate through items.
- **Accessible by default** — ARIA roles and focus management handled for you.
- **Tooltips** on root items (rail mode).
- **Letter-avatar fallback** for items without an icon (rail mode).
- **Mode-change event** for downstream code that needs to react to the toggle.

## Compatibility

- Vaadin Flow **24.9** or later — tested against 24.10. Hilla / client-side views are not in scope.
- Java **17** or later

## Installation

Add the dependency to your application's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.vaadin.addons.componentfactory</groupId>
    <artifactId>vcf-side-nav-rail</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Quick start

You can use the `SideNavRail` like Vaadin's native `SideNav` component. Add `SideNavRailItem`s to add navigational items. Please note that the normal `SideNavItem` is not suppoted.

```java
SideNavRail rail = new SideNavRail();

SideNavRailItem dashboard = new SideNavRailItem(
        "Dashboard", "/dashboard", VaadinIcon.DASHBOARD.create());

SideNavRailItem code = new SideNavRailItem(
        "Code", "/code", VaadinIcon.CODE.create());
code.addItem(new SideNavRailItem("Branches", "/code/branches"));
code.addItem(new SideNavRailItem("Pull requests", "/code/pulls"));

rail.addItem(dashboard, code);

Button toggle = new Button(VaadinIcon.CHEVRON_LEFT_SMALL.create(), e -> {
    boolean railMode = !rail.isRailMode();
    rail.setRailMode(railMode);
    e.getSource().setIcon((railMode
            ? VaadinIcon.CHEVRON_RIGHT_SMALL
            : VaadinIcon.CHEVRON_LEFT_SMALL).create());
});

add(toggle, rail);
```

### No toggle button?

The addon intentionally ships without a built-in toggle button — applications differ too much in layout for a one-size-fits-all default. Wire your own button that calls `setRailMode(boolean)` or `toggleRailMode()`.

## Configuration

Most features can be configured to your needs. Please see the following sections for how to modify the `SideNavRail` settings:

### Popover behaviour

The rail shows sub-items as a hover popover when the rail is in rail mode. For consistency, the same popover is also available in normal mode. `PopoverMode` controls when it appears:

- `ALL_COLLAPSED_ITEMS` (default) — popover for every collapsed parent, regardless of depth or rail mode.
- `ONLY_ROOT_COLLAPSED_ITEMS` — popover only for direct rail-children that are collapsed; nested levels behave like a stock `SideNav`.
- `ONLY_RAIL_MODE` — popovers only when rail mode is active; normal mode opens children inline on click.

```java
rail.setPopoverMode(PopoverMode.ONLY_ROOT_COLLAPSED_ITEMS);
```

### Popover header

`PopoverParentLabelMode` controls whether (and how) the parent's label appears as a header at the top of its popover:

- `NONE` (default) — no header.
- `LABEL_ONLY` — header shows the parent's text label only.
- `ICON_ONLY` — header shows a copy of the parent's prefix component (typically an icon) only.
- `FULL` — header shows both the prefix component and the label, icon first.

```java
rail.setPopoverParentLabelMode(PopoverParentLabelMode.FULL);
```

### Popover arrow

By default each popover renders the small Lumo arrow that points back at its target item. Toggle it off if you prefer a cleaner look — e.g. when popovers sit tightly against the rail and the arrow adds visual noise:

```java
rail.setPopoverArrowVisible(false);  // default: true
```

### Rail-mode tooltip

Because rail mode shows only icons, users may not be able to tell what each icon represents. The rail-mode tooltip surfaces each root item's label on hover or keyboard focus. Tooltips apply to the root items of the rail only. 

`RailTooltipMode` controls which root items get one:

- `NONE` — no tooltips.
- `ONLY_WITHOUT_CHILDREN` — only root items that have no children (intended to be used with the **popover parent label mode** , where a tooltip would be redundant).
- `ALL` (default) — every root item, regardless of whether it has children.

```java
rail.setRailTooltipMode(RailTooltipMode.ONLY_WITHOUT_CHILDREN);
```

> The addon comes with its own tooltip implementation, since Vaadin's native tooltip auto-dismisses itself whenever a popover opens — see [vaadin/web-components#9768](https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/issues/9768).
>
> If you prefer browser-native tooltips instead, you can activate them via `setRailTooltipNative(true)`. Note that these cannot be styled and will also not appear when focusing the rail items using the keyboard.

### Reacting to mode changes

You can react to rail mode toggles, using a dedicated event listener (`addRailModeChangedListener(...)`). Whenever the rail mode is toggled, this event listener will be informed. 

```java
rail.addRailModeChangedListener(e ->
        log.info("rail mode now {}", e.isRailMode()));
```

### Active marker on rail icons

By default, Vaadin's `<vaadin-side-nav-item>` only flags an item as `current` when its own path matches the URL — so when a deeply nested route is active (e.g. `admin/users/active`), the rail-side root icon (Admin) does not pick up the active marker. Setting `matchNested(true)` on each root item flips this: the root also counts as `current` when any descendant matches.

`setRailRootItemsMatchNested(true)` opts into having the addon manage that flag automatically: while the rail is in rail mode, each root item's `matchNested` is forced to `true`; on leaving rail mode (or turning the feature back off), the original `matchNested` value the user had set is restored. Per-item snapshotting means a `setMatchNested(...)` call you made yourself is preserved across rail-mode cycles — the override is layered on top, never destructive.

```java
rail.setRailRootItemsMatchNested(true);  // default: false
```

### Items without an icon

A root `SideNavRailItem` without an icon gets a letter-avatar built from the label automatically so that the rail still has an icon to show. This avatar is only shown in the rail mode.

```java
new SideNavRailItem("Profile", "/profile");                         // → "P" letter-avatar
new SideNavRailItem("Profile", "/profile", new Avatar("Profile"));  // → "P" letter-avatar, that is also shown in normal mode (since set explicitly)
```

## Building from source

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
```

Runs the addon's unit tests (Karibu-Testing in `addon/`) and the production-mode Playwright E2E suite (in `e2e/`).

## Running the demo

```bash
./mvnw -pl demo spring-boot:run
```

The demo runs on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
